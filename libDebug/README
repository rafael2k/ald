This library contains all of the ptrace related code which
allows single-stepping, breakpoints, and all other debugging
stuff. It is designed to be a standalone library, and can
be easily incorporated into other projects. The main external
routines are located in source/libDebug.c. The two routines which
must be called are

initDebug()
termDebug()

which initialize and terminate a debug workspace. After a
workspace has been initialized, all of the other *Debug() routines
can be called to perform debugging on a binary. Each routine
in libDebug.c is documented so that is the best place to find
out how to use this library.
