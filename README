 Hopefully the above statement works for disassembly as well :-).

 The Assembly Language Debugger is a tool for debugging programs
at the instruction level. It was born out of my frustration
with gdb's ability (or lack thereof) to debug assembly language
programs. I have tried to include as many useful features as
I could think of into ald, but I am very open to suggestions for
improvement. If you have a feature request or suggestion, please
do not hesitate to email me.
